## üí° Advanced Techniques

### Variable-Based Storytelling

```yaml
story_branching:

  - /if total_reputation < -20 /jump notorious_villain
```

### Dynamic Difficulty

```yaml

  - /if difficulty_level > 10 /jump increase_difficulty
  - /if difficulty_level < -5 /jump decrease_difficulty

increase_difficulty:
  - /score enemy_hp_multiplier 150
  - /score enemy_damage_multiplier 120
  - Difficulty increased due to performance

decrease_difficulty:
  - /score enemy_hp_multiplier 80
  - /score enemy_damage_multiplier 90
  - Difficulty decreased to help progression
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Variable Naming Best Practices

1. **Use Descriptive Names**: `player_health` instead of `hp`
2. **Consistent Naming**: Use underscores or camelCase consistently
3. **Avoid Conflicts**: Don't use Minecraft reserved words

### Performance Considerations

1. **Initialize Variables**: Set default values at the start
2. **Clean Up**: Reset temporary variables when done
3. **Limit Calculations**: Avoid excessive mathematical operations
