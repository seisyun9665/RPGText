## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Choice Naming Rules

1. **No Spaces in Choice Names**: Use underscores or CamelCase
2. **Case Sensitive**: Ensure exact matching between choice and branch
3. **Special Characters**: Avoid special characters in choice names

```yaml
# ‚úÖ Correct examples
- /? good_choice bad_choice neutral
- /?good_choice Great selection!

# ‚ùå Avoid these
- /? "good choice" "bad choice" # Spaces cause issues
- /?Good_Choice # Case mismatch
```

### Performance Tips

1. **Limit Choices**: Keep choices to 8 or fewer for better UX
2. **Clear Labels**: Use descriptive choice text
3. **Consistent Formatting**: Maintain uniform choice presentation
