# Creating Your First Script

Let's create an actual RPGText script and test it in action.

## üéØ What We're Building

We'll create a simple interactive script with greetings and player choices.

## üìù Step 1: Creating the File

Create `my_first_script.yml` in the `plugins/RPGText/messages/` folder.

```yaml
# My first RPGText script
sound: block.note.bell 1 1.5
speed: 30
color: \r

# Main greeting section
greeting:
  - /color \6\l
  - Hello!
  - /color \r
  - I'm your RPGText guide.
  - Your name is %player%, right?
  - /wait 40
  - How are you feeling today?
  - /? Very good Okay Not so great
  - /?Very good /jump good_response
  - /?Okay /jump okay_response
  - /?Not so great /jump bad_response

# When feeling good
good_response:
  - /color \a
  - That's wonderful!
  - /color \r
  - Keep having a great day.
  - /singlesound minecraft:entity.player.levelup
  - /jump farewell

# When feeling okay
okay_response:
  - /color \e
  - I see.
  - /color \r
  - I hope you find something fun to do.
  - /jump farewell

# When not feeling great
bad_response:
  - /color \c
  - That's tough...
  - /color \r
  - Don't push yourself too hard, take your time to rest.
  - I'm rooting for you!
  - /singlesound minecraft:block.note.bass 1 0.5
  - /jump farewell

# Farewell section
farewell:
  - See you again, %player%!
  - /wait 20
  - /color \6
  - Enjoy RPGText!
  - /color \r
```

## üéÆ Step 2: Running the Script

Execute the following command in-game to test your script:

```
/rpgtext config <player_name> my_first_script.yml/greeting
```

Example:

```
/rpgtext config Steve my_first_script.yml/greeting
```

## üìñ Script Explanation

### Features Used

1. **File-wide Settings**

   ```yaml
   sound: block.note.bell 1 1.5
   speed: 30
   color: \r
   ```

2. **Color Codes**

   - `\6\l` - Gold + Bold
   - `\a` - Dark green
   - `\e` - Yellow
   - `\c` - Dark red
   - `\r` - Reset

3. **Special Variables**

   - `%player%` - Display player name

4. **Wait Command**

   ```yaml
   - /wait 40
   ```

   Wait for 40 ticks (2 seconds)

5. **Player Choices**

   ```yaml
   - /? Very good Okay Not so great
   ```

6. **Branching Logic**

   ```yaml
   - /?Very good /jump good_response
   ```

7. **Sound Effects**
   ```yaml
   - /singlesound minecraft:entity.player.levelup
   ```

## üîÑ Step 3: Try Customization

### Adding More Choices

```yaml
- /? Very good Okay Not so great Secret
- /?Secret /jump secret_response

secret_response:
  - /color \d
  - A secret...?
  - /color \r
  - How intriguing.
  - /jump farewell
```

### Changing Sounds

```yaml
sound: block.note.flute 1 2
```

### Adjusting Display Speed

```yaml
speed: 50  # Faster
# or
speed: 15  # Slower
```

## ‚ö° Step 4: Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: Script doesn't work

**Check:**

- File is in the correct location
- YML format is correct (indentation, etc.)
- Section names are correct

### Issue 2: Text appears garbled

**Solution:**

- Save file in UTF-8 encoding
- Check color codes

### Issue 3: No sound

**Solution:**

- Verify sound name
- Check client volume settings

## üöÄ Next Steps

Once you can create basic scripts, learn more advanced features with these documents:

- **[Commands Reference](../commands/README.md)** - Detailed explanation of all commands
- **[Practical Examples](../examples/README.md)** - More complex samples
- **[Variables and Scoring](../commands/variables.md)** - Managing game progression
- **[Conditional Logic](../commands/conditions.md)** - Complex branching

## üí° Learning Tips

1. **Start small and expand gradually** - Begin with simple features
2. **Reference other examples** - Study `tutorial.yml` and practical examples
3. **Test as you go** - Learn by doing rather than just reading
4. **Check error logs** - Look at server logs when issues occur

Good luck creating your amazing stories!
