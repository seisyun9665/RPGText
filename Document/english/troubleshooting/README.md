# Troubleshooting

Common problems with RPGText and their solutions.

## üÜò Emergency Procedures

### When Scripts Don't Work

1. **Check File Location**

   ```
   plugins/RPGText/messages/your_file.yml
   ```

2. **Verify Execution Command**

   ```
   /rpgtext config <player_name> <filename>/<section_name>
   ```

3. **Check Server Logs**
   - Look for error messages in the console

## üîç Problem Identification

### Step 1: Symptom Verification

- [ ] Script doesn't work at all
- [ ] Some commands don't work
- [ ] Display issues
- [ ] Error messages appear

### Step 2: Basic Checks

- [ ] File is in the correct location
- [ ] Command syntax is correct
- [ ] Player name and section name are correct
- [ ] Server supports RPGText

### Step 3: Detailed Investigation

- [ ] Check server logs
- [ ] Test with minimal configuration
- [ ] Verify if same issue occurs with other players

## üöë Emergency Fixes

### Emergency Workarounds

```yaml
# Minimal test file for operation verification
test.yml:
  test_section:
    - Test successful!
    - RPGText is working normally
```

Execute:

```
/rpgtext config <player_name> test.yml/test_section
```

### Recovery from Backup

1. **Restore Configuration Files**

   ```
   plugins/RPGText/config.yml
   ```

2. **Restore Message Files**

   ```
   plugins/RPGText/messages/
   ```

3. **Restore Player Data**
   ```
   plugins/RPGText/players/
   ```

## üõ†Ô∏è Self-Help Tools

### Diagnostic Script

```yaml
# diagnostic.yml - Diagnostic file
system_check:
  - === RPGText Diagnostics ===
  - Player: %player%
  - Level: %level%
  - Health: %hp%
  - /score test_var 123
  - Test variable: \\test_var\\
  - /singlesound minecraft:entity.experience_orb.pickup 1 1
  - Audio test completed
  - /color \a
  - Basic functions are normal
  - /color \r
```

### Log Analysis Procedure

1. **Identify Error Type**

   - Syntax error
   - Runtime error
   - Logic error

2. **Locate Error Position**

   - Check line numbers
   - Check command names
   - Check parameters

3. **Determine Fix Strategy**
   - Syntax correction
   - Logic changes
   - Design review

## üìà Prevention

### Development Precautions

- **Test in Small Units** - Don't create large files all at once
- **Backup Habits** - Regular saving
- **Syntax Checking** - Verify YML format
- **Incremental Implementation** - Expand gradually from basic functions

### Operational Precautions

- **Regular Maintenance** - File organization
- **Log Monitoring** - Early error detection
- **User Feedback** - Reports from players
- **Update Planning** - Schedule for feature additions and fixes
